				The homework instructions tell us to make this about ourselves.  I decided to make it about my favorite sports, table tennis.  I know some people will scoff table tennis is not a sport.  I have just the video for those people.

				The following is an excerpt from WikiPedia:
				Table tennis, also known as ping pong, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using a small bat.  A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage.<br><br>

				<br>
				<br>
				I wanted to make the portfolio page all table tennis images.  However not finding enough images, I settled on including several images of several sports including one I don't recognize. Click on the Portfolio tab to go to the images page.

				Enjoy !
